Remainder Operators in C:
The remainder operator (%) is used to find the remainder of the division of two integers.
This code demonstrates the use of the remainder operator in C.
Lets get remaindering...

// This code demonstrates the use of the remainder operator in C.
// The remainder operator (%) is used to find the remainder of the division of two integers.
// The code defines a function `remainder_operator` that performs the operation and prints the result.
// The main function calls this function to execute the demonstration.

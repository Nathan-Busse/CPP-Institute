/*

Unary operators in C++ are operators that operate on a single operand. 
They perform operations such as incrementing or decrementing a value, negating a value, or performing logical negation. 

Here are some common unary operators in C++:

    1. Increment Operator (++) - Increases the value of a variable by 1.

    2. Decrement Operator (--) - Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

    3. Unary Plus (+) - Indicates a positive value (usually redundant).

    4. Unary Minus (-) - Negates the value of a variable.

    5. Logical NOT Operator (!) - Inverts the truth value of a boolean expression.

    6. Bitwise NOT Operator (~) - Inverts the bits of an integer value.

    7. Address-of Operator (&) - Returns the memory address of a variable.

    8. Dereference Operator (*) - Accesses the value at a given memory address.

    9. Sizeof Operator (sizeof) - Returns the size of a data type or variable in bytes.

    10. Type Cast Operators (static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast)

// These operators are used to manipulate data and perform operations on single operands in C++. 
// They are essential for various programming tasks, including arithmetic operations, logical operations, and memory management.

# where to begin?

Every creative activity needs tools, and programming-
is no exception. 

In its simplest form programming requires a sheet of paper and a pencil.

However it is best to practice by writingg raw code,
	since running the code is the only method of-
	finding out whether it's correct, -
	programming requires a computer equipped with-
	soome additional tools.
	
In this document, we'll show you some ways of using-
your computer as a developer's workstation.
However, *don't* forget that there are many factors-
affecting actions that *must* or *mustn't* be-
performed:
	- Hardware platforms. 
	- Operating System. 
	- OS version
	- etc
	
The c++. institute the creator of this course,  does not-
know your sytem,  so their guide is general.

Hence they will show you the direction - 
you will have to find solutions yourself.

Unfortunatelly, all of there suggestions require access to the internet - either perminent or tempporary. 
You need to download virtuallly all installation files
from the products' sites. Other tools work online only.
Sorry, there are no workarounds.

By the way, you can successfully run all there programs-
and examples without the use of any specialized environments - only by using a standaed text editor and command-line compiler tools. 

However, c++ Institute *don't* recommend it, and that's why we will be using some special applications that will enable us to utilize a range of tools in one place. 

Generally, there are two ways in which we can advise you:
	- using locally insstalled IDE. 
	- using on-line tools.

# what is IDE?

IDE ( *Intergrated Development Envionment* ) is a software application that taypically consists of:
		-1 Code editor. 
		-2 Compiler. 
		-3 Debugger. 
		-4 GUI builder.

Programming with an IDE has many advantages: you get a toolkit containing everything you may need. Real programmers usually use an IDE too. An IDE gives you a comfortable desk equipped with all means, supplies and aids.

There are some disadvantages, too. Comfortable desks usually weigh a lot. So do IDEs. They may consume a lot of resources and, frankly speaking, you probably don’t need most of the functions they can perform.

Using on-line tools allows you to write, store and run your code without installing anything. Imagine it as a simplified IDE accessible remotely via the Internet. That means that you need two things: an Internet browser and Internet access.

If you can try both approaches, then choose the one that’s more convenient for you. If you can't – choose the one you can use.

# Choose your IDE
There are many IDEs on the market, both free and not free. To get a rough idea of how big the list of integrated development environments for the C language is, you can visit this

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#C.2FC.2B.2B page.

We wrote and tested all our examples with NetBeans. It doesn't mean that we think NetBeans is the best. It may be that other products are more in line with your tastes and habits, so you don’t need to follow our path. Feel free to make your own decisions. However, please be aware that very few of the exercises in this course may be preconfigured for NetBeans.

For this reason, you need to remember that some practical elements of the course might not work in some other IDEs the way we intended them to work.

We want to show you 5 sample IDEs. Again, this doesn’t mean that we think they’re better than the others – they may be more popular than many others, or we do actually like them for various reasons (not all technical reasons). Here they are:

Unfortunately, we can’t provide any support in the installation and/or use of any IDE, either for the ones we mentioned and the ones we didn’t mention. If you run into problems, seek help from vendor of your software or (recommended) from other users of the particular product. There are many available sources: FAQs, forums, help-desks, communities, knowledge bases, etc. It’s unlikely that your problem hasn’t already happened to somebody else, and if it has, it’s very likely that it was solved. Search for solutions and you’ll find them.

If you’re a Linux user, try to use your primary system tools to download and install an IDE. If you use any other OS, search for a complete native installation package.

# On-line tools: ideone
To get started with programming, you don't have to install anything. 

The first one is a tool named ideone available at
- http://ideone.com. 

Although you don’t need to register to start your work, we suggest that you do – it’ll enable some additional, valuable features.

Signing up is easy – certainly not more difficult than the registration on the C++ Institute website. 
- https://edube.org/learn/c-essentials-part-1/www.cppinstitute.org

You can also use your Facebook account to sign into ideone – it’ll make the whole process even faster and more convenient.

After signing in, you’ll have to do some customizing, and two things are essential: change your default programming language to “C” (don't forget to do that) and then enable syntax highlighting – it’ll make it easier to do your work.

To test the *ideone* environment, go to the “new code” tab and just copy-and-paste the following text into the source code field:
<script type="c">
#include 

int main(void) {
    printf("It's working\n");
    return 0;
}	
	
</script>

Next click the “Ideone it” button. Text saying “It's working” should appear almost immediately in the stdout field – this means that your source code has been happily compiled and run.

Easy? Easy! But... there’s one catch: you’re not allowed to send more than 1000 submissions a month. We don't think that’s really going to affect you, though.

Something important: if your program reads any data from a user, you’ll have to prepare the data inside the stdin field before the code is run (normally the process of reading input is interactive).

Check <url ref= http://ideone.com/faq> FAQ</url> for more details.

On-line tools: codepad
Codepad is another on-line tool with a very similar functionality. It’s available at http://codepad.org.

Again, you don’t need to register to start your work, and its principle operation is very similar to ideone (although codepad doesn't offer as many useful features as ideone). It also allows you to create your own project to group your files.

###Edube Interactive
We've got some more good news!

This course does not require you to install any software applications or use any external Internet sites to test your code and do the exercises.

To test or experiment with your code, you can use a dedicated, interactive on-line programming environment - Edube Interactive, embedded in the course.

Edube Interactive is a tool integrated with this course, which can be used as a browser-based C language sandbox that allows to run and test code discussed throughout the course, as well as launch, perform and do lab exercises specifically designed for this course.

##Sandbox
The Sandbox interface consists of three main parts:

-the Editor window, which lets you type in your code,
-the Console window, which lets you see the output of your programs,
-and the Action Buttons bar, which lets you run your code, refresh the editor window, download or upload your programs which will be displayed in the editor, and the Settings button, which lets you adjust display settings and switch between C/C++ compilers and Python interpreter or simulator.

##Study Mode

Study Mode (you're using it now) let you navigate between the course pages, labs, quizzes, and test either by clicking the arrow(s) located next to the page title, or by opening the Course menu, which will display all the resources available in the course or a given module.

Edube has been designed to enrich your learning experience throughout the course and allow you to test your code from desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices. For the best learning experience, we advise that you take advantage of all the benefits that come with Edube Sandbox, Labs and Course Resources, as well as install a local programming environment.

*Edube Interactive is still in beta.* We are working hard to improve the functionality of the tool.

At all times you are more than welcome to share your thoughts with us and send us your feedback. We do care for providing you with the best possible learning resources and learning experience, that’s why we’ll be happy to hear about your valuable suggestions and observations. Edube Interactive labs, study resources, quizzes, and tests can be accessed only from within this course. Still, everyone is more than welcome to use the Sandbox feature!

Now it's time to start learning some real programming.

Please carry onto Part 1:  Module 1, Thank You.
